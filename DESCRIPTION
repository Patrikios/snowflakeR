Title: Lightweight R6 Connector and Helpers for Snowflake via ODBC.
Version: 0.1.0

Description: A small, focused package providing an R6-based Snowflake connector
    over ODBC with convenient query execution (glue-sql interpolation), 
    data.table attributes for lineage, and simple transaction and write helpers. 
    Credentials are expected to be provided by your ODBC DSN and/or function 
    arguments; no YAML or similar parsing of credentials is included. Functionality 
    includes reading data from and writing data to your Snowflake account as well 
    as execute queries and supports simple transactional processing. A system 
    requirement (outside R) is a Snowflake ODBC driver + a configured DSN on the 
    host.
