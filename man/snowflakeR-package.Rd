\title{snowflakeR: Lightweight R6 Connector for Snowflake via ODBC}
\description{
A small, focused package providing an R6-based Snowflake connector over ODBC with convenient query execution (glue-sql interpolation), data.table attributes for lineage, and simple transaction and write helpers. Credentials are expected to be provided by your ODBC DSN and/or function arguments; no YAML or similar parsing of credentials is included. Functionality includes reading data from and writing data to your Snowflake account as well as execute queries and supports simple transactional processing. A system requirement (outside R) is a Snowflake ODBC driver + a configured DSN on the host.
}
\section{Philosophy}{

\itemize{
\item Keep credentials outside the package (DSN / environment / call args).
\item Keep usage simple (R6 with \verb{$run_query()}, \verb{$write_data()}, transactions).
\item Keep strings safe using \code{glue::glue_sql()} (with \code{.con} binding).
\item Attach SQL lineage with \code{data.table::setattr()}.
}
}

\section{Requirements}{

You must have the Snowflake ODBC driver installed and working, and a DSN
configured on your system. The package does \strong{not} read YAML config files.
